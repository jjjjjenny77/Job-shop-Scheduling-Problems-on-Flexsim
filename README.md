# Job-Shop-Scheduling-Problems-on-Flexsim
> This note record and share the final project of Simulation course about constructing FlexSim models to solve Job-Shop scheduling problem, and find the minimum Cmax
## Problem instances: 
Demirkol’s instances cscmax 20×15 (DMU41 – DMU45) (https://optimizizer.com/DMU.php)
## Goals:
1. Modeling skills (Show your efforts and expertise in modeling complex problems using simulation)
2. Problem-solving skills (Show your understanding of JSPs and optimization techniques to solve the problem)
3. Research & Applications (Survey literature and summarize JSP applications in Intelligent Scheduling)
## Data Processing
We have to use the data in Demirkol's instances and do data analysis by Excel. Here are the outcome of processed data (https://reurl.cc/XRWom0)
